**Detect and Prevent the impact of Natural Disasters**

This is the idea for our project for codefundo++ tech challenge

The idea is to develop a mobile application, to be used in and around the regions effected by some natural disaster.
The mobile application will have two main purpose:

**Disaster Management**
There is a huge shortage of resources and supplies during and after a natural calamity strikes a region. There are many NGOs and government relief funds which build camps for supplying resources. But often not every one affected is able to take advantage due to lack of information. The main idea behind our application is to give these organizations or any one who wants to help in the locality, a platform to list their resources, and for people in need to search for resources near their locality. 
So if a person wants to act as a provider, he/she can register in the application and fill a form with fields like the resources, locality, GPS location etc. 
When a person in need registers in the application, he/she can see what all resources are available in the locality and get map direction to the place.
In the future we are also planning for using this application as a tool where people can mark themselves as safe for other people to get to know.

**Disaster Detection**
We will apply data mining algorithm such as LDA and topic clustering algorithms on the data collected form twitter, news feed and blogs APIs to predict the present state of the disaster. Based on the severity of disaster and the radius of the impact, the people registered on the application will get notified. The application will also suggest some standard measure to the people based on the disaster.
